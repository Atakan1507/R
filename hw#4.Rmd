Discussions and Comments on the Elbow plot:

After applying the elbow method to the K-Means clustering analysis, we obtained an elbow plot showing the total within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for various numbers of clusters. Upon visual inspection of the plot, we observed a clear elbow point at K=2, indicating a significant drop in WCSS up to that point

Considering the business context and domain knowledge, a K value of 2 seems to be a reasonable choice. It strikes a balance between maximizing the separation of data points in different clusters while maintaining a manageable number of clusters. Furthermore, a higher number of clusters may lead to decreased interpretability and increased complexity.

Therefore, we have decided to proceed with K=2 as the most reasonable number of clusters for this analysis. This choice allows us to capture meaningful patterns and variations in the dataset while ensuring computational efficiency and interpretability

# Step 3: Perform hierarchical clustering with minimum linkage
dist_matrix <- dist(data_subset)  # Compute the distance matrix
hclust_model <- hclust(dist_matrix, method = "single")  # Hierarchical clustering using single (minimum) linkage

# Step 4: Plot the dendrogram
dend <- as.dendrogram(hclust_model)  # Convert the clustering result to a dendrogram object
plot(dend, main = "Dendrogram of Wells")  # Plot the dendrogram

# Step 5: Determine a reasonable distance cut-off
# Examine the dendrogram and identify distinct clusters based on the vertical lines that cut across the dendrogram horizontally.
# Look for a height or distance at which the clusters form separate branches or subclusters.
# Consider the business context and domain knowledge to determine a suitable cut-off point that results in meaningful and interpretable clusters.

```
After analyzing the 50 dendrograms generated from the hierarchical clustering process, we examined the clustering structures and identified a reasonable distance cut-off that resulted in meaningful and interpretable clusters.

Upon visual inspection, we observed that as the height or distance increased along the vertical axis of the dendrograms, distinct clusters or subclusters started to form. We focused on identifying the cut-off points where these clusters showed clear separations and meaningful grouping patterns.

To compare the dendrograms, we noted the consistent changes in clustering structure as the number of clusters varied. We observed that the height at which clusters formed or merged varied across dendrograms, indicating different levels of similarity or dissimilarity.

Additionally, we applied the elbow method to assess the dissimilarity measures for each dendrogram. By plotting the number of clusters against the dissimilarity measure (e.g., average linkage distance or within-cluster sum of squares), we looked for the "elbow" point where the rate of change in dissimilarity significantly slowed down. This suggested a potential natural breaking point for clustering.
